<ul>I have created Cricket Data Analytics using Power BI, DAX and Excel.
This Cricket Stats is based on Top 10 runs scorers and Top 10 wicket takers from each of the three format ie ODI,Test and T20I.
I have took this stats from ESPN cric info till latest ie 2025.
These stats are then uploaded on csv file which is available at repository.
Some DAX Functions are written as per requirement.</ul>
<h2>Enjoy</h2>
